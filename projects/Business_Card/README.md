# Personal Details Card

I am a very beginner to the PCB designing and followed the above tutorial to make the business card. I can give my personal details that are pre-programmed to the NFC Chip inside when tapped to a phone.

It will cost about $40 for the final PCB Design

I decided to make the business card but decided to change things by a little such as PCB Color, how the texts are positioned and also while ordering it said some of the components are not available too. After PCB Arrives I can practice my soldering skills as well.
